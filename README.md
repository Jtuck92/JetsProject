## Jets Project
### Overview
This program was written as a Week-3 homework assignment for Skill Distillery. Its function is to simulate a theoretical spaceport
filled with ships from the Star Wars universe. Each ship is catagorized by a type, a name, its speed, range, and how much it would (presumably) cost.
The program then assigns the user the role of Fleet Commander, and prompts them to issue orders to affect the vessels under thier command.

### Topics
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Packages
* Abstraction
* Polymorphism
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Array Lists
* File Readers
* Reading from .txt
* Interfaces
* Swtiches

### How To Run
1. The user is immediately presented the menu wich contains the orders they are authorized to issue to the spaceport. 
2. The user is provided with a default roster of ships that will behave as the menu commands direct.
3. The user may add custom vessels or delete any created or existing craft.
4. Resigning from thier command exits the program.

### Lessons Learned
This was an enormous project, dwarfing the assignments of previous weeks. The ordered minimum viable product took nearly 
10 hours to fully implement and test. The biggest lessons taken from this excercise were how to organize a program that consists 
of several different functions and processes, as well as how to manage the time and energy of the programmer effectivley.
